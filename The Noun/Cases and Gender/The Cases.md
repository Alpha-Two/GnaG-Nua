In Irish there are 5 cases: the nominative, the accusative, the genitive, the dative, and the vocative.

In the official standard there are supposedly only now 3 cases, where nominative, accusative and dative are combined. The dative has, however, often its own forms and even if the form of the cases is the same, there are other rules for lenition and eclipsis, therefore, it is not possible to ignore the dative.

Nominative and accusative are always the same, and even defenders of the dative don't see the accusative any more as an autonomous case, so 4 cases remain: nominative/accusative, genitive, dative and vocative.

Here, all 5 cases are described, because they are also discussed singly in Irish language grammar references in Irish. In Irish grammar books in English, the nominative/accusative/dative are combined as the "common case".

# The Nominative *(An Tuiseal Ainmneach)*

The nominative is used as the **subject** of a clause. Additionally it is used as the **subject** and **predicative noun** of a copula clause.
The nominative and accusative forms are identical.
The dative form is also, with a few exceptions, identical to the the nominative form.
In some dialects, non-standard dative forms are often used in the nominative (e.g. _Éirinn_ instead of _Éire_, in Conamara e.g. _bróig_ instead of _bróg_)

The nominative is used with the following prepositions: _**seachas, go dtí**_  
(both contain a verb form, whose subject is the noun in the nominative: seachas = seach + is, go dtí = "until coming")

## nominative singular *(ainmneach uatha)*

This is the **base form**, as one would find in the dictionary.

## nominative plural *(ainmneach iolra)*

Forming the plural (iolra) is even in the standard quite irregular, and it is often different in the dialects, which makes the matter even more difficult.
Basically, one can speak of two different ways of forming the plural:
### **_the weak plural (an lagiolra)_**

This is almost exclusively present in the 1st + 2nd declension, but is quite common.

**1st declension**: nominative plural = genitive singular e.g.: _leabhar - leabhair_  
or: plural suffix **-a** e.g. _cleas - cleasa_
**2nd declension**: plural suffix **-a** e.g.: _bróg - bróga_

It is called **_weak_**, because only the stem is modified in the plural, a stem-supplementary (consonant containing "real") plural suffix is not present. The plural forms are different in the genitive ( = nom. sing.) and sometimes also in the vocative( suffix -a).
In some dialects, instead of the the weak plural form, strong plural suffixes are often given preference (e.g. _nasc-nascanna_ instead of _naisc_).
### the strong plural *(an tréaniolra)*

It is formed by adding different **_suffixes_**:  
e.g.: **í, -acha, -anna, -tha** etc. (e.g.: _bás - básanna_)

It is called **_strong_**, because the stem in the plural is "supplemented" with additional consonants (-í was formerly written -idhe).
The  plural suffix is the same in all cases. They were once modified (e.g.: nominative/accusative _-anna_, genitive _-ann_, dative _-annaibh_), but in all cases today (nominative, genitive, dative and vocative) they are unchanged (e.g.: _-anna_).
Originally, these suffixes were limited to certain declensions (e.g. -acha for nouns of the 5th declension with -ach in the genitive, or -anna with -ann in the genitive), but they spread out in Modern Irish over the other declensions.
Their "popularity" is due to the clarity of the tagging as a plural, comp. _naisc_ (weak plural ) with _nascanna_ (strong plural).
Often, different plural suffixes are used, partially also seemingly several plural suffixes: In Connacht e.g. -thaí (-tha + -í), -annaí (-anna + -í), etc. (where this -í is probably the [dative-plural suffix](#dative-plural-tabharthach-iolra-dative-plural) -ibh, spoken in Connacht as [i:])

## nominative dual *(ainmneach déach)*

Not to remain unmentioned that in Irish there are still traces of the dual (the pair, an déach).
It occurs only following the number 2 (dhá).

The **dual form** (not only in the nominative, but in all cases, also in the genitive-dual and dative-dual) is always the same as the [[The Cases#**dative singular (tabharthach uatha)**|dative-singular]] :
e.g.: _cos = a foot_ (nominative-singular), _cosa = feet_ (nominative-plural )  
_ar an gcois = on the foot_ (dative-singular),  
_dhá chois = two feet_ (nominative/genitive/dative-dual)  
In the genitive-dual, the genitive-plural form can also be used (where the genitive following a number is rather atypical)  
see also [footnote](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/zahl4.htm#dual) in Chapter 11 (Numbers)
# **the genitive (an tuiseal ginideach):**

## **use of the genitive**

- noun as the _attribute_ of another noun  
    genitive attributives always _follow_ the definite noun. They resemble attributive adjectives.
    In German there are often compounds instead of a genitive.
    The meaning of the attributive can be:
    - partiality ([partitive genitive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#partitiv)): _cuid airgid = a share of the money_
    - origin: _mac Sheáin = the son of Seán_
    - ownership, membership: _teach an fhir = the man's house_
    - material: _teach adhmaid = wooden house ("house [of] wood")_
    - contents: _bosca chíste = cake box ("box [of] cake")_
    - specific purpose: _fear an tí = man of the house_
    - description: _lá Nollag = December day ("day [of] December")_
    - use: _bróg cailín = girls' shoe_
    - title, name: _Scoil Bhríde = Brigid School_
    - monetary value, age, other measurements: _stampa scillinge = 1 shilling stamp, leanbh bliana = one-year-old child ("child [of one] year")_
    - Apposition: some genitives are called [appositions](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#appos), often to specify gender: _baintreach fir = widower ("widow [of] man" > "widow+man" > "male widow"), dochtúir mná = female doctor("doctor [of] woman" > "doctor+woman" > "female doctor"), macaoimh mná = young woman ("young person [of] woman" > "female young person")_
    - object of transitive action:  
        After a noun that denotes a transitive action, always the _object_ of the action takes the the genitive, not its subject:  
        _grá Dé = the love for God_ (not: the love of God! In German the form "die Liebe Gottes" would more mean the latter!)
    - subject of intransitive action:  
        Only after nouns, that describe intransitive (objectless) actions, can one use the genitive to describe the subject:  
        _imeacht na traenach = the departure of the train; seitreach capaill = horse's whinny ("whinny [of the] horse")_
- noun as the _object_ of the [verbal noun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom.htm)
    - definite noun _after_ the verbal noun:  
        _Tá sé ag déanamh na hoibre = He is doing the work ("He ist at doing the work")_
    - indefinite noun _after_ the verbal noun, when it has no further attribute:  
        _Tá sé ag cur báistí = It's raining ("it is at laying [a] rain")_
    - noun with the preposition a (= "zu")that comes _before_ the verbal noun, when the verbal noun itself is the attribute of another nouns (in Ger. most Partizip I); see also [verbal noun as an attributive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom1.htm#Attribut):  
        _fear na mná a phógadh = the man that is kissing the woman ("man that woman to kiss")_
- noun following definite _prepositions_
    - after the genitive prepositions (originally nouns) [trasna](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#trasna), [chun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/chuig.htm), [cois](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#cois), [timpeall](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#timpeall), [fearacht](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#fearacht), [tar éis](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#tareis)  
        e.g.: _trasna an ghoirt = across the field ("across of the field")_
    - after [derived prepositions](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#abgeleitet) (that contain nouns) e.g. _ar aghaidh = in front of ("on face")_  
        e.g.: _ar aghaidh an tí = in front of the house ("on face of the house")_
- after _quantities_ (see [partitive genitive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#partitiv))
    - after nouns like mórán (much), beagán (little), neart (a bit), roinnt (some), dóthain (enough), breis (further), cuid (share) e.g. _roinnt bainne = some milk_
    - after adverbs like go leor (a lot, enough), níos mó (more) e.g. _níos mó bainne = more milk_
- nouns, esp. the verbal noun, forming _participles_, mostly with the prefixes so-, do-, in-. With regular nouns, today this is rare, and with a verbal noun, the genitive is often equivalent to a verbal adjective, hence the details are there(see [verbal adjectives](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbadj.htm)).

The **form** of the genitive is **_not_ used** when:

- when _two nouns in the genitive_ directly follow one another, to avoid a double genitive  
    Instead the first is lenited in the nominative and only the second is in the genitive. This is the so-called **"functional genitive"**, the first noun is "functional" in genitive relation, but keeps the nominative form and is lenited.
    - This is always the case, if the 2nd noun is definite:  
        e.g.: _teach mhac Sheáin (the house of the son of Seán)_ but _teach (an) mhic = the house of (the) son (genitive)_
    - If the 2nd noun is indefinite, a **double genitive** is also possible:  
        e.g.: _seol an bháid adhmaid = the sail of the wooden boat ("sail of the boat [of] wood")_
    - If the 1st noun is a verbal noun, it is then **always** in the genitive (see [verbal noun as the attributive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom1.htm#Attribut))  
        e.g.: _lucht foghlamtha na Gaeilge = the Irish learners ("people [of the] learning of Irish")_
    - If the noun describes a _quantity_ (e.g. neart, roinnt, cuid, etc) and if a partitive genitive follows the dative. e.g.: _Tá sé ag ól roinnt bainne = He's drinking some milk_
- with nouns as the _object_ of the [verbal noun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom.htm)
    - if an indefinite noun follows the verbal noun and is given _a further attribute_. e.g.: _Tá sé ag léamh leabhar maith = He is reading a good book_ (see asldo [genitive with the verbal noun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom1.htm#Genitiv))
    - if a noun with the preposition a (= "zu") _precedes_ the verbal noun in infinitive constructions ("infintiv with to"), rather the accusative.
        e.g.: _Ba mhaith liom cluiche a imirt = I would like to play a game ("would be good with-me, a game to play"_)
    - if a verbal noun is the _object_ of another verbal noun. Instead, as in German, in infinitive construction is used:  
        e.g.: _ag iarraidh fiafraí = trying to ask_
- with nouns + numbers
    - nouns following cardinal- and ordinal numbers (only after 1 or 1st is the genitive possible, but not after 11 etc.)  
        e.g.: _teach an dara fear = the house of the second man, stampa dhá scilling = 2 shilling stamp_
    - nouns followed by numbers or letters as numbers (_roth bus a haon = the wheel of bus nr. 1_)
- with feminine proper names, if they have an adjectivial attribute or stand next to a surname:  
    e.g.: _teach Bhríd Rua = the house of the red-haired Bríd, teach Bhríd Ní Cheallaigh = Bríd Kelly's house_ (aber: _teach Bhríde = Bríd's house_)
- after the noun cúpla:  
    e.g.: _Tá sé ag ól cúpla deoch. = He is drinking a few drinks._
- after prepositions, that actually require the genitive
    - if the noun is part of an infinitive construction.
        e.g. _le linn an cluiche a bheith ar siúil = while the game was on_ (no genitive) but _le linn an chluiche = during the game_ (genitive)
    - if a verbal noun comes _directly after_ a derived preposition.
        e.g.: _le linn dul abhaile = on the way home_ (see also [genitive + verbal noun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/verbnom1.htm#Genitiv))
    - if a verbal noun comes directly after chun in the sense of _in order to_ .
- depending on the dialect sometimes the genitive is left aside [ [1](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#fn1) ]

## the partitive genitive and the partitive dative (an ginideach rannaíoch agus an tabharthach rannaíoch)

- the genitive can specify a part of the whole. This is the **partitive genitive** (in German, one uses the nominative instead of the genitive)  
    e.g. _roinnt airgid = some money (lit.: "a share of money"), ceathrú úill = a quarter of an apple_
- Instead one can choose to form this by a _definite_ noun of the **partitive dative** with the preposition [de](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/de.htm) + article ( in German there would be here rather the partitive genitive!). This is especially so if the first noun should remain _indefinite_:  
    e.g.: _cuid den airgead = a share of the money("part of the money"), ceathrú den úll = quarter of the apple ("from the apple"), roinnt de na fir = some of the men ("share of the men")_
- The partitive dative ist always necessary, if _both_ nouns are definite (also here one would use the genitivein German): _mo chuid den airgead = my share of the money ("my part of the money")_

## particulars of definite genitive-attributives

- In the definite genitive-attributives, **the antecedent itself counts as definite**. So it is not allowed to become definite itself (e.g. by adding an article or a possessive pronoun)!  
    e.g.: _teach an dochtúra = **the** house of the doctor_ (_nicht_: **a** house of the doctor!)  
    _teach m'athar = **the** house of my father_ (_nicht_: **a** house of my father!)  
    _teach Sheáin = John's house_ (_nicht_: **a** house of Johns!)  
    (This is equivalent to the German W suffixes like "_Johns Haus_", or "_des Kaisers Bart_", where the genitive attribute is definite and through this also the antecedent becomes definite; as opposed to: "_**der** Bart des Kaisers_", where both nouns have to carry the article)
- Combinations of a definite genitive attribute with an indefinite remaining antecedent are also not possible (e.g. _a house of the doctor_). Here one needs instead a dative: e.g. _teach don dochtúir = a house of the doctor, lit.: "a house to-the doctor"_

## **genitive singular (ginideach uatha)**

**Form:**

- The formation of the genitive occurs in various ways.
    Through this, the [declension groups](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst1.htm) differentiate themselves from one another. Te formation is (relatively) simple and regular (provided, one knows to which declension group a word belongs to)

## **genitive plural (ginideach iolra)**

**Form:**

- **_= nominative-singular_** with the **_weak_ plural**  
    In the standard, this encompasses most of the nouns of the 1st declension  
    e.g.: _an fear - na bhfear_ (the man - of the men),  
    as well as many of the 2nd declension nouns (but often depalatalised!)  
    e.g. _an bhróg - na mbróg_ (the shoe, of the shoes); _an tsúil - na súl_ (the eye, of the eyes)
- **_= nominative-plural_** with the **_strong_ plural**  
    Here are mostly the nouns of the 3rd and 4th declension, most of the 5th , some of the 2nd and 1st declension.
    e.g.: _an cailín - na cailíní - na gcailíní_ (the girl- the girls- of the girls) [ [2](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#fn2) ]
- **_= genitive-singular,_** Here are some of the nouns of the **5th declension (with the genitive singular on -n, -d)**  
    e.g.: _an cara - an charad - na gcarad_ (the friend- of the friend- of the friends)  
    in some exceptions also with the genitive singular on -ch: _na caorach - na gcaorach_ (of the sheep, of the sheep)
- _**autonomous Form**_ (exceptions)  
    e.g.: _bean - ban_

## **lenition / eclipsis** in the genitive

- **indefinite nouns**:  
    To simplify, one could say that indefinite genitive attributives act like attributive adjectives (s.a. [lenition of adjectives](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/adjekt3.htm#Lenition))
    
    > **unlenited** after _masculine_ nouns in the nominative singular  
    > e.g. _fear céile = husband_  
    > **lenited** after _masculine_ nouns in the weak plural (on slender consonants)  
    > e.g. _na fir c**h**éile = the husbands_  
    > **lenited** after _masculine_ nouns, that _are in the genitive themselves_ (on slender consonants)  
    > e.g. _an fhir c**h**éile = of the husband, teach pobail b**h**aile = the church of a town_  
    > **lenited** after _feminine_ nouns in the nominative singular  
    > e.g. _bean c**h**éile = wife_  
    > especially:
    > 
    > - after femin. nouns of quantity: _punt phrátaí = 1 pound of potatoes_
    > - genitive of the verbal nouns: _bean chaointe = wailing woman_
    > - with the appositive genitive (animals and things): _cráin mhuice = the sow of the pig_
    > - with the genitive of material: _tine mhóna = turf fire_
    > 
    > **unlenited** after _feminine_ nouns:
    > 
    > - with the partitive genitive (part of, lack of, excess of...) _roinnt bainne = some milk_
    > - with the appositive genitive (with people): _baintreach fir = widower ("male widow")_
    > - with the genitive of category (with people): _bróg cailín = girls' shoe ("shoe for a girl")_
    > - with genitive of action: _seitreach capaill = horse whinnying_
    > - with body parts or parts of things: _láimh duine = human hand_
    > - after a fem. verbal noun, if following a preposition (mostly): _ag iarraidh comhairle = to ask for advice_
    > - after a fem. verbal noun, if used as an indefinite regular noun
    > - after abstract nouns, e.g.: _saoirse cainte = freedom of speech_
    > - after collectives, if it's the genitive plural : _buíon fear = a troop of men_
    > - if the noun in the genitive has an attribute: _bean baile mhóir = big-city woman_ (but: _bean bhaile_)
    > - after [derived prepositions](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/genpraep.htm#abgeleitet) e.g. _in aghaidh múinteora = against a teacher_
    
- [article](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/artikel.htm)**-**carrying **definite nouns**  
    The rules are defined by the article.
    
    > **lenited:** after _a masculine_ genitive-singular-article (_an_) (e.g. _teach an f**h**ir = the man's house_  
    > **unlenited:** after _a feminine_ genitive-singular-article (_na_) (e.g. _teach na mná = the woman's house_)  
    > **eclipsed:** after a genitive-plural-article (_na_) (e.g. _teach na **bh**fear, teach na **m**ban = the men's house, women's house_ )
    
- [possessive pronoun](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/possess.htm)-carrying **definite nouns**  
    again the rules are defined by the possessive pronoun.
    
    > **lenited** after _mo, do, a_ (masc.) (e.g. _rogha a c**h**airr = the wheel of his car_)  
    > **unlenited** after _a_ (fem.) (e.g. _rogha a cairr = the wheel of her car_)  
    > **eclipsed** after _ár, bhur, a_ (plur.) (e.g. _rogha ár **g**cairr = the wheel of our car_)
    
- **proper names and other definite nouns in the genitive**
    
    > principally **lenited** (e.g. _fear C**h**áit = Kate's man_)  
    > Not lenited: names with: Mo.., Do... (both former vocative forms), Maol...
    > Not lenited: words like: Dé = of God, San = Saint. e.g.: _glóir Dé = the Glory of God_  
    > Not lenited: names of saints after: Féile = festival, San = Saint, Naomh = Holy e.g.: _Lá Fhéile Pádraig = St. Patrick's Day_  
    > Not lenited: foreign names, e.g.: _dán Goethe = Goethe's poem_
    
- **after genitive prepositions**
    
    > indefinite nouns after _chun, dála, timpeall, fearacht, trasna_ are mostly **unlenited**
    

---

# **the dative (an tuiseal tabharthach):**

## use of the dative:

- It is used as the **indirect object**  after most simple [prepositions](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/praepos.htm):  
    **_a, ag, ar, as, chuig, de, do, faoi, go, i, ionsar, le, ó, os, roimh, thar, trí, um_** (and in the plural after **_idir_**)
- as opposed to German, in Irish, a dative object _**without a preposition is not possible**_.
    If in German the dative _without_ preposition would appear, in Irish often one must use the _preposition_ [do](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/do.htm) (= to) : comp.:
    - _Ich gebe das Buch der Frau_ =I give the woman the book = **irisch:** _Tugaim an leabhar don bhean_ (lit.: "...to the woman")
    - _Ich gebe dir das Buch;_ = I give you the book= **irisch:** _Tugaim an leabhar duit_ (lit.: "...to you")
- a differentiation of the static locative (dt. dative: "in der Schule"=in the school) from the dynamic locative (dt. accusative: "in die Schule"=into the school) is not common anymore in Irish [ [3](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#fn3) ]  
    This is independent of if a special dative form or the nominative form is used: _sa tigh = in the house/into the house_ or. _sa teach = in the house/into the house_
- the dative with [le](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/le.htm) and [do](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/do.htm) is used for personal relationships, similar to German _"von"_, to express an indefinite person: e.g.: _deartháir le Seán = a brother of Seán's, uncail dóibh = an uncle of yours, cara dom = a friend of mine_  
    (instead of the genitive for definite persona: _deartháir Sheáin = Seán's brother, bhur n-uncail = your uncle, mo chara = my friend_)
- similar with [le](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/le.htm) to show ownership/copyright of an indefinite object: _dán le Goethe = a poem by Goethe_ (as opposed to the genitive: _dán Goethe = Goethe's poem_)
- The **partitive dative (an tabharthach rannaíoch)** with the preposition [de](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/de.htm) is often useds in place of the [partitive genitive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#partitiv) (see also there), to identify a part or a quantity of things:  
    _cuid den obair = share of the work, beirt de na mná = two of the women_
- the dative **of the agent, dativeus auctoris (an tabharthach gníomhach)** acts as the _logical_ subject of some clausal constructs without a grammatical (nominative-) subject, see [subjectlessness](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/satz2.htm#sub). e.g.: _Is as Dóire dom = I'm from Derry, le linn gloine a ól dom = while I drink a glass_
- additionally, the dative form, if available, appears **after the number 2**. Actually, this is the nominative of the **duals (an déach)**, which has the same form as the dative-singular. e.g.: _dhá bhróig = two shoes, a dhá cois = her two feet_

## **autonomous dative forms:**

- An autonomous _form_ hardly has the dative in the standard anymore.
    This is similar to German, where dative forms also sway (vgl. _dem Manne / dem Mann_)=the man's/of the man.
- This is why, today at least, the dative form **= nominative form**
- In the official standard there are also **still common dative forms** (5 words of the 2nd declension,  Éire is the 5th decl.):  
    _cos-cois (foot), lámh-láimh (hand), bróg-bróig (shoe), bos-bois (palm), cluas-cluais (ear),_  
    _Éire-Éirinn (Ireland),_
- some words appear in definite set W suffixes in the old dative form:  
    _ceann-cionn_ (= head e.g. in _os cionn = above_), _ciall-céill_ (sense e.g. in _cur i gcéill = to convince, to bring sense (to s.o.)_)

Sometimes (like in dialects and in older literature), one finds other dative forms:

## **dative singular (tabharthach uatha)**

The dative of all nouns in the [2nd declension](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/2dekl.htm) (not only the 5 above mentioned words) is formed via **palatalisation**: e.g. _bróg-bróig, fearg-feirg, fuinneog-fuinneoig, teach-tigh_  
The dative of the [5th declension](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/5dekl.htm) with the genitive on a borad -n or -d is formed **palatalisation of the genitive**: e.g.: _Éire (Nom.)-Éireann (Gen.)-Éirinn (Dat.), fiche (Nom.)-fichead (Gen.)-fichid (Dat.)_

Often, these dative forms of both declensions appear instead of the nominative:  
e.g. _Éirinn_ colloq. much more common than the official _Éire = Ireland_, today always _Albain_ instead of _Alba = Scotland_, _abhainn_ instead of _abha = river_  
in Connemara _bróig_ instead of _bróg_, _fuinneoig_ instead of _fuinneog_ (words of the 2nd decl.) in the nominative.

In the[1st](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/1dekl.htm) , [3rd](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/3dekl.htm) and [4th](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/4dekl.htm) declension, the dative form is, since a long time, always the same as the nominative form.
In the [1st](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/1dekl.htm) declension, some dative forms in a few set W suffixes (as mentioned above: _ceann = head- os cionn = overhead_ ) are maintained. (the dative was once formed via "u-colouration" of the final consonant)

The dative irregular nouns: the dative of _bean_ ist _mnaoi_, that of _lá_ is _ló_ (e.g. _sa ló = per day_)

## **dative plural (tabharthach iolra)** {#dative-plural}

The dative plural of all declensions is formed with the addition of the suffix **-ibh**. (originally related to the latin suffix -ibus, comp.: _viribus = the men_) (e.g. _fear-fearaibh, bróg-brógaibh_ etc.).

The form depends on the nominative-plural , independent of the other declension:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**nominative plural**|**dative plural**|**example**|
|palatalised|depalatalised + -**aibh**|an fear - na f**i**r - leis na fear**aibh** (with the men)|
|-**(a)igh**|-**(e)achaibh**|an marcach - na marc**aigh** - ag na marc**achaibh** (with the riders)|
|suffix -**a**|suffix -**aibh**|an bhróg - na bróg**a** - sna bróg**aibh** (in the shoes)|
|suffix -**e**|suffix -**ibh**|an cara - na caird**e** - ag na caird**ibh** (with the friends)|
|suffix -**í**|suffix -**íbh**|an cailín - na cailín**í** - leis na cailín**íbh** (with the girls)|
|suffix -**anna**|suffix -**annaibh**|an bus - na bus**anna** - sna bus**annaibh** (in the busses)|
|suffix -**acha**|suffix -**achaibh**|an nead - na nead**acha** - sna nead**achaibh** (in the nests)|

  
In some dialects of Munster this form often replaces the nominative-plural (_fearaibh = men_, instead of _fir_).
Also the additional nominative plural suffix, common in Connacht, -í stems from the old dative plural (e.g.: _-annaibh_ > _-annaí_; through the local pronunciation of -ibh as [i:])  
As a real dative, this is hardly in use any more and has been replaced in the standard by the nominative-plural.

## **lenition / eclipsis in the dative**

Because the dative only follows a preposition, the rules of lenition are defined by the preposition.

**without article:**  
After **_ag_, _as_, _chuig_, _fara_, _le_** there is neither lenition nor eclipsis.
After **_ar_, _de_, _do_, _faoi_, _ionsar_, _ó_, _roimh_, _trí_, _thar_, _um_** one **lenites** (general terms do not follow after ar and thar)  
After **_i_** one **eclipses**. (also after the today rarer **_iar = after, go = with_**)

**with the singular-article:**  
In the **standard**, for most prepositions there is a choice, either **lenition** (common in Ulster) or **eclipsis** (in Munster and Connacht) (_ar an mbád_ or _ar an bhád = on the boat_)  
After **_den_** (de + an), **_don_** (do + an) and **_sa(n)_** (i + an) the standard **lenites** (_den chathaoir = of the chair_, _san fharraige = in the sea_)  
**d, t, s** are neither lenited nor eclipsed (_den doras = of the door, ar an doras = on the door, don sagart = to the priest_)  
Feminine nouns beginning with s (+ vowel or l, n, r) receive a **t- prefix** (_ar an tsráid = on the street_)

In the **dialects**, lenition and eclipsis are governed by different rules (see also the overview [article and preposition](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/artikel.htm#praeposition))

**with the plural article**  
No lenition or eclipsis.

# **the accusative (an tuiseal cuspóireach):**

The accusative form is always the same as the nominative form.
The rules of lenition and eclipsis are, as well, same as in the nominative.
So can one tell the accusative from the nominative - only via the function/syntax.

the accusative is used with a **direct objecten** of a verb and of the clause:  
e.g.: _Chonaic mé an fear = I saw the man_ (direct accusative object: _an fear_)  
The **direct object** of the **verbal noun** is in the accusative, if it precedes it and is connected to _a = to_.
e.g.: _an fear a fheiceáil = to see the man_  
As in German, the accusative is used in adverbial **time expressions**  
e.g.: _Bhí mé ann an oíche sin / an bhlian seo caite = I was there last night/ last year_ (accusative-time expression: _an oíche sin_ or. _an bhliain seo caite_)

Aside from those, the following **prepositions** require the accusative: _**ach, gan, idir, mar, ná**_  
_idir_ requires the dative with nouns in the plural (there, idir has more the meaning of "among": _idir mná = among women_)

# **the vocative (an tuiseal gairmeach)**

## **use of the vocative**

The vocative ist the"form of address", used when **speaking to** a person or thing (if you are the sort to talk to inanimate objects)  
There is no such case in German, but in other languages(comp. latin: Marce Aurelie = Marcus Aurelius!, Domine! = Lord!, et tu, Brute? = you too, Brutus?)

The vocative **form** is **_not_** used by nouns and adjectives (but always the vocative particle), if

- the terms of inanimate objects are used as a name for people (_a stór! = Darling_) and
- In the case of collectives (_a phobal = People!_)
- if a definite noun follows in the genitive: _a mhac Bhriain = Son of Brian!_ (except in certain terms and proper names: _a Mhic Dé = Son of God!, a Mhic Bhriain = Mr. MacBrien!_)

## **formation of the vocative:**

- nouns: always with [vocative particle](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/sonstig.htm#vokativpartikel) and **always lenited** (if possible)!  
    e.g.: _**a** S**h**eáin = Seán!_  
    The vocative particle doesn't have the acclamatoric meaning of the German/English "O/oh!", it is rather unstressed and flown over. As a stressed appell in Irish, one can, in addition to the vocative particle, use the word **ó** (following) : (_a Sheáin ó = oh Seán!_)
- the use of the possessive pronoun in the form of address (like in English: e.g. _my friend!_) is not common (_a chara = (my/dear) friend!_) except sometimes in the religious setting: _ár nAthair atá ar Neamh = Our Father, who art in Heaven..._
- also appositive personal pronouns in the form of address (in English e.g. _you Idiot!_) are not common (_a amadáin = Idiot!_)

## **vocative singular (gairmeach uatha)**

- **1st declension**: vocative = **genitive singular**  (e.g. _fear - a fhir = man!)_
- **2nd -5th declension**: vocative = **nominative singular** (e.g.: _cailín - a chailín = girl!)_
- following adjectives that are attributive are always **lenited**
- after masculine nouns (1st -5th declension!) adjective form = genitive singular, (e.g.: _a fhir mhóir = big man!_)
- after feminine nouns adjective form = nominative singular (_a bhean mhór = big woman!_)

### **exceptions**:

- **Ó** in names in the vocative form = _Uí_  (after that, lenition, h- entfällt)  e.g.: _a Phóil Uí Shé! = Paul O'Shay!_
- **Mac** in names in the vocative form = _Mhic_ (after that, lenition, c after Mhic is not lenited) e.g.: _a Sheáin Mhic Sheamais! = Seán McHamish!_
- **mac** vocative form = a mhic! _or also_ a mhac! ("Son!")
- **leanbh**  vocative form = a linbh! _or_ a leana! ("Child!")
- **Mícheál** vocative form = a Mhícheáil! _or_ a Mhíchíl!

## **vocative plural (gairmeach iolra)**

- **weak plural**   vocative = **nominative singular + suffix a**  
    (e.g. _a fheara! = Men!_)
- **strong plural :** vocative = **nominative plural**  
    (e.g. _a bhuachaillí = Boys!_)
- following adjectives remain always **unlenited**, the form is the same as the nominative plural  
    (e.g.: _a fheara Gearmánacha! = German men!_)
- following other attributives remain as well **unlenited**  
    (e.g. _a fheara céile = Husbands!_)

# _Apposition (Comhaisnéis)_

This is the term for 2 or more nouns following one another, that lexically belong together.
e.g. _an tAthair Ó hAnluan = Father Ó hAnluan, Seán gabha = Seán, the blacksmith_  
Mostly, the 2nd noun is today in the nominative. But for the following cases:

- In the case of **title + surname**, the surname is always in the same case as the title.
    e.g. genitive: _teach an Athar Uí Anluan = the house of Father Ó hAnluan_, vocative: _Dia dhuit, a Athair Uí Anluan = Hello, Father Ó hAnluan!_
- In the case of **title + first name (+ surname)** the name remains in the nominative, only the title is declined.
    e.g.: _an Bráthair Seán Ó Cléirigh = Brother Seán O'Cleary, teach an Bhráthar Seán Ó Cléirigh = Brother Seán O'Cleary's house_
- In the case of **first name + noun** the noun remains in the nominative.
    e.g.: _leabhar Sheáin gabha = Seán the blacksmith's book_, _teach Phóil, mac an dochtúra = Paul the son of the doctor's house_
- In the case of **two titles** the 2nd title is in the genitive (_**appositive genitive**_), but the article comes before the first title:  
    e.g.: _an Tiarna Easpaig = Lord Bishop_ (lit.: "the lord [of a] bishop")
- as well, the appositive genitive appears actually with **2 regular nouns**. (see under genitive, e.g. _baintreach fir = widower_ [widow + man], _múinteoir mná = female teacher_ [teacher + woman]). Aside from such formations, today, mostly the 2nd noun remains in the nominative.
- Often instead of an apposition, a copular relative clause ("who is..."):  
    e.g. _an t-amadán is mac duit = your son, the fool (lit.: "the fool, that your son is")_  
    or also a dative with [de](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/de.htm):  
    _amadán de mhac = an idiot of a son, gliogar de chathaoir = a cripple to the chair_ )
- If a personal pronoun stands with a noun in apposition, a preposition is with both: e.g. _léi leis an mbanríon = with her, the queen_

# _definite nouns (ainmfhocail chinnte)_

A noun counts as **definite**, when

1. it is with the **article** e.g.: _an fear = the man_
2. it is with a **possessive pronoun** e.g.:  _bhur bhfear = your man_
3. it occurs with **gach** (every) e.g.: _gach fear = every man_
4. it is **numerated** , e.g.: _fear a haon = man Nr.1_
5. i is a **proper name**, e.g. _Seán_
6. it is a unique place or person (then always without article) e.g. _neamh = Heaven, ifreann = Hell, Dia = God_
7. it's carrying anoter definite noun as the **genitive attributive** e.g. _teach an dochtúra = the house of the doctor, teach Sheáin = the house of Seán's_  
    (see [particulars of the definite genitive attributive](http://nualeargais.ie/gnag/subst2.htm#best))
8. it's in the **vocative** e.g.: _a fhir = man!_
